# Omise Code Challenges

[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/shtakai/challenges.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

This repository houses Omise's interviewing code challenges. These are small hands-on
projects that are very relevant to the tasks you will be working on at Omise.

### Ground Rules

* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time,
  if you need it. A rushed job is usually matched by a swift rejection.
* Average completion time so far has been around one to two weeks.
* Submission is done via a [git patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch). Attach
  your patch in an e-mail and send it to [jobs@omise.co](mailto:jobs@omise.co).


### Challenges

Pick the one that most suites the position you wish to apply.

* Backend / Ruby on Rails - [tamboon-rails](https://github.com/omise/challenges/tree/challenge-rails)
* Frontend / React - [tamboon-react](https://github.com/omise/challenges/tree/challenge-react)
* Mobile App / iOS and Android - [tamboon-mobile](https://github.com/omise/challenges/tree/challenge-mobile)

### Free Style Challenge

If you feel that none of the challenges are sufficient to demonstrate your coding ability,
you can also choose to submit any project of your own choosing that you are most proud of.
